{"author": 1, "title": "What is Django and the Advantages and Disadvantages of using it", "image": "df4dc72910b4e0ea730759add25489f4.png", "text": "Python is one of the most famous programming languages in the world and it was the second most used language in GitHub projects in 2017. So if you\u2019re interested in Python and in web development, you\u2019ve most probably heard of Django. The rising fame of web frameworks nowadays makes it quite confusing to learn a new framework and choose which one you want to work with. Today, we take an extensive look at Django to be able to wrap our heads around this amazing technology.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">What is django?</span>\r\n\r\nDjango is an MVT web framework used to build web applications. It defines itself as a \u201cbatteries included\u201d web framework, with robustness and simplicity to help web developers write clean, efficient and powerful code. It is among the most famous web frameworks out there in the world and it\u2019s one of the most used frameworks as well. It\u2019s used by Instagram, Youtube, Google and even NASA for their website \r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">The Structure</span>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://djangobook.com/wp-content/uploads/mtv_drawing1.png\">\r\n\r\nDjango follows an MVT architecture which stands for Model-View-Template. MVT is a Django variation of the famous MVC structure, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll feel it\u2019s quite analogous to how other frameworks work. When the Django server receives a request, the URL router maps the request to the appropriate view. The view then fetches the data through the models, fill the template and send it back to the user.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">Django's Models</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://djangobook.com/wp-content/uploads/Django_ORM_600.png\" >\r\n\r\nDjango\u2019s model makes use of a powerful ORM layer which simplifies dealing with the database and the data and accelerates the development process.\r\n\r\nWithout Object-Relational-Mapping, developers would have to create the tables themselves and define the queries or procedures which sometimes translates to the hefty amount of SQL that is prone to be complex and hard to track.\r\n\r\nThe ORM layer lets you write all the table definitions in simple python code, and it takes care of translating that to the appropriate query language chosen, and it also facilitates the CRUD operations.\r\nIn fact, the developer doesn\u2019t necessarily need to know the complex SQL altogether or what it translates to, though, it worth noting that understanding SQL would allow you to write better and faster queries and also make your website more secure.\r\n\r\nUnlike other frameworks, the models are all placed in one file, conventionally, models.py, which might make it feel crowded for bigger projects.\r\n\r\nDjango supports many database systems. SQLite is really good for testing and development because it could be used right out of the box without having to install further software. For production, you can go for MYSQL or PostgreSQL, and if you\u2019re looking for a NoSQL database, you can use MongoDB with Django, and here\u2019s a further read on the topic.  \r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">Django's Tamplates</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/37d8bf79-3a4c-48ed-b871-e1971c47e244/flexbox-mini1.jpg\">\r\n\r\nDRY is one of Django\u2019s core template design principles and it\u2019s a design pattern that stands for Don\u2019t-Repeat-Yourself. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, it means that you shouldn\u2019t, at least in most cases, by copying and pasting the code. Instead, your template, for example, should be divided into reusable components such as the side navigation bar, the main navigation bar, the header of the page, the footer of the page and so on. This minimizes repetition and makes for writing efficient and cleaner code.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that Django makes distinct of itself is how seriously it considers security. This indeed affects the writing of the template.\r\n\r\nIn Rails, for example, you can write ruby code inside your views -not saying it\u2019s something you should do-, and you can also assign values to variables.\r\n\r\nIn Django, this is not the case at all, you cannot run python code in the template and you can\u2019t assign a value to a variable. Simply put, Django forbids code-execution in the template layer and only gives access to display logic, which is a simple yet extremely effective solution to many web vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">Django's Views</span>\r\n\r\nThe View in Django is the business logic layer. It\u2019s responsible for processing the user\u2019s request and sending back a valid response. It fetches the data from the model, gives each template access to specific data to display, or it could perform some processing over the data beforehand. Nowadays, Django\u2019s views can be functions processing the request and returning a response, or they can be classes capable of much more in a similar manner to Laravel and Rails controllers.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">The URL router</span>\r\n\r\nThe URL router in Django is more complicated than in other frameworks, say Rails or Laravel. The problem with it is that it uses regular expressions which are not easy to use for beginners. However, the structure of the URL router itself is not complicated at all, it\u2019s just the syntax that you might not be comfortable with at first.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">Advantages of Django</span>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: #001c3b;\">1. Batteries included</p>\r\n\r\nDjango prides itself as a batteries-included framework. What that means is that it comes with a lot of stuff out of the box, that you may or may not use depending on your application. Instead of having to write your own code (the power), you just need to import the packages that you want to use.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a part of the convention over configuration paradigm that Django is part of, and it allows you to make use of the solutions implemented by world-class professionals. Django batteries span a wide range of topics that include:\r\n\r\n_Authentication with auth package\r\n _Admin interfacing with admin package\r\n _Session management with Sessions package\r\n _Managing temporary or session-based messages with Messages package _Generating Google sitemap XML with Sitemaps package\r\n _Postgres special features with Postgres Package\r\n_Hooking into \u201ctypes\u201d of content with content types framework\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: #001c3b;\">2. Python</p>\r\n\r\nSince Django uses Python, it leverages some of the fame and power of python to its own benefit. Python is arguably one of the easiest -if not the easiest- programming language to learn for beginners, and it\u2019s also quite popular in introductory computer science courses around the world. The 2017 Stackoverflow Developers Survey revealed that Python is now more common that PHP and Python jobs pay better than C# and C++.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: #001c3b;\">3.Community</p>\r\n\r\nDjango\u2019s community is one of the best things about it, they are helpful and actively working on making the framework more beginner-friendly and stabilizing the framework while adding new features. Django\u2019s documentation is quite thorough and is useful as a standalone tutorial, it will help you wrap your head around various features so you can use it as a primary source of information.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: #001c3b;\">4. Scable</p>\r\n\r\nMost developers, when thinking about picking up a framework plan for the future in their choice. That\u2019s why picking a scalable framework is quite essential for many, and Django is just that. It allows you to take a lot of different actions regarding scalability, as Nigel points out in his article, such as running separate servers for the database, the media and the application itself or even use clustering or load-balancing to distribute the application across multiple servers.\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: #001c3b;\">5. Built-in Admin</p>\r\n\r\nThe Django team was quite thoughtful when they created the framework, and they kept user and client satisfaction in mind. It\u2019s quite unreasonable to create your own admin interface at the backend just to be able to manage your data with basic CRUD operations. That\u2019s why Django offers an administrative interface right out of the box that is both professional and versatile, according to the documents the developer can now develop with the presentation in mind.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 700;  color: #001c3b;\">Disadvantages of Django\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nWhile Django is an amazing framework, there are a few cons that may or may not be a problem for you. First, the URL specifying with regular expressions is not an easy task to accomplish, at least for beginners. It also feels a little bloated for small projects, and some people find it quite populated with big projects since models, for example, are all included in a single file. Template errors fail silently by default, so if you don\u2019t know that, you might waste a lot of time trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with the application, or even worse, you might not even know that your application has a problem. It\u2019s also a strongly opinionated framework, which gives it a monolithic feeling. There\u2019s one popular and advised way of doing things and you\u2019re supposed to follow it.", "created_date": "2019-10-03T00:47:34Z", "published_date": "2019-10-03T00:47:50Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"author": 2, "title": "test update image work or not", "image": "img3.jpg", "text": "local variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignmentlocal variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignmentlocal variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignmentlocal variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignmentlocal variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignmentlocal variable 'stuff_for_frontend' referenced before assignment", "created_date": "2019-10-11T07:36:50.859Z", "published_date": null}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"author": 2, "title": "Advantages of Bootstrap framework", "image": "id-9973.9973.pdf-000.jpg", "text": "Creating a website is not just to promote your business, it helps in creating brand awareness, gives a platform for people to interact, approach and discover as well. To market a product or service effectively, you should have a web page that is viewable in a variety of devices. In today\u2019s world you have smart phones, tablets, laptops, desktops and an ongoing increase in the kind of devices and form factors. Hence to solve the issue of being able to view websites or content on all such devices effectively, we can use bootstrapping.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >What is Bootstrap?</span>\r\n\r\nBootstrap is a front-end framework that is developed to support creating dynamic websites and web applications. It is one of the most preferred front-end frameworks as it aids an easy and fast processing to develop a website. It supports all major browsers and fast loading responsive web pages.\r\nBootstrap consists of HTML and CSS-based design templates for various interface components and is aimed to ease web development. By updating the CSS, you can adapt to modern trends quickly. The developers should concentrate more on interaction components as the bootstrap itself will take care of standard views of data, which can be altered later if you wish to.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.dtelepathy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bootstrap.jpg\"  >\r\n\r\nBootstrap is compatible with almost all the latest version browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Safari. It supports the responsive web design and dynamically adjusts the layout of web pages by considering the characteristics of the device used.\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><h2>Advantage of Bootstrap</h2></div>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >Speed of Development</span>\r\n\r\nThe speed of development is one of its major advantages. If you want to develop an application or a website promptly, it is imperative to consider using Bootstrap. It helps to save your coding effort by offering less CSS functionality and pre-built blocks of code rather than structuring code from the scratch. Ready-made themes of Bootstrap will help achieve your needs through a faster route.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >Responsiveness</span>\r\n\r\nAccording to CISCO\u2019s predictions, global mobile data traffic will increase approximately 11-fold between 2013 and 2018. These statistics points to the need for a responsive website in varied kinds of mobile devices.\r\n\r\nBootstrap is equipped with responsive layout and 12-column grid system that help dynamically adjust the website to a suitable screen resolution. The \u2018responsive utility classes\u2019 feature of Bootstrap enables you to hide / show a certain section of content for a particular screen size.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >Consistency</span>\r\n\r\nConsistency was the fundamental principle behind the introduction of Bootstrap. It ensures the ultimate consistency regardless of designer/developer, who is working on it. Moreover, the results work uniformly across various browsers and the output remains same.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >Customizable</span>\r\n\r\nBootstrap facilitates abundant customization and helps developers in designing tailor made websites, according to their specifications. It has the facility to select any feature that is actually needed to create a customized website. With this feature, one can get rid of what they do not require.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\" >Support</span>\r\n\r\nBootstrap facilitates abundant customization and helps developers in designing tailor made websites, according to their specifications.

This section details the installation of the Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows 10. I think the Anaconda distribution of Python is the best option for problem solvers who want to use Python. Anaconda is free (although the download is large which can take time) and can be installed on school or work computers where you don't have administrator access or the ability to install new programs. Anaconda comes bundled with about 600 packages pre-installed including NumPy, Matplotlib and SymPy. These three packages are very useful for problem solvers and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps below to install the Anaconda distribution of Python on Windows.\r\n\r\n  Steps:\r\n         1. visite Anaconda.com/download\r\n         2. select Windows\r\n         3.
